1. Start
2. Get current date from the system

Extract day, month, and year.

3. Calculate moon phase

add the date into the moon phase function.

create a function to get the moon phase based off the date.

4.ask the user for location

read location 
display possible stars/constellations seen from that hemisphere

5. Ask the user to enter the AQI

Read AQI from the user.

6. Determine visibility

Use location, moon phase(illumination factor) and AQI to compute a visibility.

Decide which constellations can be seen under these conditions.

7. Display results

Show moon phase.

Show visibility level.

Show list of visible constellations.
