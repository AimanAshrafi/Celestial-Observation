add the date into the moon phase function.

create a function to get the moon phase based off the date.

4. Ask the user to enter the AQI

Read AQI from the user.

5. Determine visibility

Use moon phase(illumination factor) and AQI to compute a visibility.

Decide which constellations can be seen under these conditions.

6. Display results

Show moon phase.

Show visibility level.

Show list of visible constellations.
